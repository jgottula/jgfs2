todo list


license:
- add source code headers: adapt AVRm68k header
  - include makefiles/redo scripts
  - do this for the justix tree as well

fs design:
- use inodes
  - only put filenames and inode nums in dirents
  - metadata is stored elsewhere
- use extents maybe
- sparse files (nonallocated extents)
- free space bitmap
- hard links
  - trivial: multiple dirents with same inode number
  - not so trivial: need refcount in inode so free space bitmap (and inode
    table, if one exists) know the file is freed after the last link is rm'd
- no journal
- fs attributes
  - boot
    - this can probably be mutually exclusive with compression
    - read-only by default?
  - compression
- backup superblocks
- compression
  - lzo or other lz derivative
  - or: use custom arithmetic coding algo
  - not for early-boot files (kern, default params, kern syms)
  - break extents into 'super-clusters', then compress them and store them in
    fewer clusters as much the compression ratio allows
  - refuse to compress if the compressed file takes up just as many clusters
    - or more!
  - level of granularity?
    - file: probably best
    - extent: maybe
    - supercluster: no
  - mount option
    - default: fs-specific
    - fs attribute for default mount compression behavior
      - settable at mkfs time
      - changeable by fs attrib change utility
  - implement in a manner that allows for multiple algos
  - need an ioctl and chattr-like utility for file-specific changes
    - must ensure file is not open or being read in any way!
    - alternative: in fuse, create a char device or fifo for communication
      with utils, like zfs
  - what mechanism will we use to manually specify that the boot files should
    not be compressed?
    - mount with compression off while doing these writes
    - turn their compression off after writing them

lib:
- reduce number of functions
- abstract directories
- consolidate dir functionality (ONE function, so multi-cluster dirs are easy)
- enforce character set in names

mkfs:

fsck:
- come up with a more comprehensive list of checks
- write it

fuse:
- implement multi-cluster directories
- touch directory dir_ents whenever their contents are changed in any way
  (need specifics on this)
- fsync/msync on writes if possible

defrag:

fsctl:
- check that fs is unmounted
- changeable:
  - label
  - uuid
  - compression
  - ...

attr:
- be able to change any fs attribute currently defined
